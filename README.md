<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b> 
- <b>Orcale Virtual Box</b>
- <b>Python</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Flare VM</b>
- <b>RemNux</b>
- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
- <b>Begin by downloading a Window 10 Iso File and Orcale Virtual Box from the links below</b>
- <b>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</b>
- <b>https://www.virtualbox.org/</b>
- <b>Configure a virual box with the Windows 10 iso with the following hardware requirments:</b>
- <b>requeriments.png</b>
- <b>Once the Win10 Machine is up and running take a snapshot before we download and install FlareVM</b>

- <b>Once the Win10 machine has a snapshot we need to download the FlareVM software. Now we need to change administator execution policy using a admininsator Powershell. Run the command "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted"
-<b>Now we are going to download FlareVM using the link below. On the link find installer.ps1 and copy the link address and paste with a wget in the terminal. "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mandiant/flare-vm/main/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing -outfile C:\Users\YourUserName\Desktop\install.ps1" 

- <b>https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm</b>
- <b>Before we run the powershell script we need to disbale Windows defender through group policy. To do so use the windows key + r then type gpedit.msc to open the group policy editor. Then go down the branches Administator Templates -> Windows Componets -> Microsoft Defender Antivirus -> Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus </b>
- <b> Now we are set too install FlareVM in the terminal run the command ".\intall.ps1" to begin the installation</b>
